## Sierpinski Triangle Experiments in SVG

This branch catalogs my efforts with generative art based around Sierpinski Triangles using d3. This is really a proof of concept for future generative art ideas - Sierpinski triangles seemed to be the most common (and versitile) fractal pattern that was very well documented. A heaping big chunk of my inspiration for this project was [Andy Gilmore](http://crowquills.com/) and my desire to automate an artistic process that would create abstract patterns with aesthetic value.

## Built With
* d3.js

## Resources Used
* [Adam Piece's Zoomable Sierpinski Triangle](http://roadtolarissa.com/zoomable-sierpinski-triangle-with-d3-js/)
* [Antonio Marquez-Raygoza's Sierpinski Triangle Page](http://www.oftenpaper.net/sierpinski.htm)
* [This JSfiddle I found on d3 hexagons](http://jsfiddle.net/LJuRp/)

## Special Thanks
* David Zabner, for support and guidance on the more mathy parts of this experiment
* Will Ballard, for lighting the fire under my ass to actually do this.
