  "description": "This branch catalogs my efforts with generative art based around Sierpinski Triangles using d3. This is really a proof of concept for future generative art ideas - Sierpinski triangles seemed to be the most common (and versitile) fractal pattern that was very well documented. A heaping big chunk of my inspiration for this project was [Andy Gilmore](http://crowquills.com/) and my desire to automate an artistic process that would create abstract patterns with aesthetic value.",
